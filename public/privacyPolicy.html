<p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</strong><br>
We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to you and our company employees, and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>
LookUpTrials is a mobile application (app) that publishes crowd-sourced information and knowledge about clinical trials. The app provides highly curated information on selected clinical trials. You may look up the up-to-date trial information by searching or filtering key terms. This privacy policy informs you about what information is collected by LookUpTrials and how the information is used and shared. This privacy policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review it from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong><br>
The information contained in LookUpTrials is public and is viewable and searchable by anyone around the world.</p>

<p>When you use LookUpTrials, even if you’re just looking at the presented information, we may receive some personal information from you like the type of device you’re using and your location. You can choose to share additional information with us like your email address, educational degree, occupation/position in a public profile. We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing you more relevant Rx blog.</p>

<p>If you downloaded this app from the Apple App Store we will receive from them non-identifying information such as the number and geographical dispersion of users, the number of downloads, and other utility matrices. These matrices may be used for business and research analyses such as to understand the usability and popularity of the application and/or to improve the performance of the application.</p>

<p><strong>BASIC ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong><br>
You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching for clinical trial information or printing the eligibility criteria of the trials. If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you. On LookUpTrials this includes a display name (for example, “LookUp Trials”), an email, and a password. Your display name is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. You can also create and manage multiple LookUpTrials accounts per your choosing.</p>

<p><strong>PUBLIC INFORMATION</strong><br>
Most activities on LookUpTrials are public, including your profile information when you created your account, updates on clinical trials, including the date, time, and time zone.</p>

<p>You are responsible for your information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information. If you update your public information on LookUpTrials, such as by changing your name or educational degree, we will reflect your updated content on LookUpTrials for iOS.</p>

<p>By publicly posting content, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our application programming interfaces (APIs), and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same.</p>

<p>This application contains the functionality to allow you to email the generated reference information from the application, but please be reminded that while most email service providers have security procedures in place to help ensure the privacy of email, we cannot guarantee such privacy.</p>

<p>If you uninstall this application, any information you entered will not be deleted. There is currently no function in LookUpTrials to deactivate a created account.</p>

<p>However, you may use the application as “Guest” without logging in. Information you choose to enter into the application under a “Guest” account will only be used and viewable by you and those you allow to use or view it. For example, you may choose to print and share the information you enter into the application with your doctor. Settings of the “Guest” account are saved under your own device and only available to others should you choose to show them.</p>

<p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</strong><br>
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our company employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>

<p><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent in accordance with applicable law. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
